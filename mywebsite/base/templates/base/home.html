					<h4>My First Project as a Developer</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>My first project as a programmer holds a special place in my heart as it was a pivotal moment in my journey. This particular assignment, given in a class, required me to create a Python program for encryption and decryption with a specific letter shift.</p>

					<p>Spending two days on this project was a truly transformative experience, and it deepened my passion for programming.</p>

					<p>It was through this assignment that I realized how much I loved programming, and it motivated me to explore and learn more in this exciting field.</p>

					<h5>My Experience as a Developer</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>My experience as a developer has been primarily focused on frontend and UI/UX development during my time at RDX Delta Rabbit. In this role, I have had the opportunity to design, build, and oversee various projects as the sole developer. These experiences have significantly enhanced my understanding of both frontend and backend web development.</p>
					<p> I am currently working as a full-stack developer, allowing me to expand my skills at my own pace while taking on diverse projects.</p>

					<h5>How I Learn</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>Reverse Engineer & Build Ugly Prototypes First.</p>

					<p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference.</p>

					<h5>My Short Term Goals</h5>
