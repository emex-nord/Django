# Django Projects

This repository features two distinct projects developed using Django. The first project is a dynamic portfolio website, while the second project is a versatile to-do application. Explore the details and documentation for each project below."

# My Simple Portfolio Website - Project 1

Welcome to my repository, which contains my first Django projectâ€”a simple portfolio website. This project was created as a learning exercise to grasp the fundamentals of Django, and it reflects my journey as a beginner in web development.

## Project Overview

In this project, I built a basic Django application with a single app called "base." The main purpose of this website is to showcase my understanding of Django's core concepts and to provide a simple portfolio platform.

## Key Features

- **Server Creation**: I set up a Django server to host my website locally.
- **Homepage URL**: I created a URL mapping for the homepage and linked it to the main URL configuration of the project.

## Project Structure

The repository structure is organized around Django's standard layout, including the "base" app where the core functionality resides. You won't find any fancy features or complex functionalities in this project. It's all about getting to grips with the basics of Django.

Feel free to explore the code and see how I implemented Django's fundamental concepts in building this straightforward portfolio website. Whether you're a fellow learner or just curious about Django development, I hope this project serves as a helpful resource.

#  To-Do App - Project 2
My second project is a To-Do App that handles simple Create, Update, and Delete operations using Django. This project taught me everything about models, databases, and a lot more about Django.

## Project Overview
In this project, I developed a Django-based To-Do application that allows users to manage their tasks effortlessly. It served as a practical exercise to deepen my understanding of Django's database capabilities and model-driven development.

## Key Features

- **Task Management**: Users can create, update, and delete tasks.
- **Database Integration**: The project extensively uses Django's models and database integration for storing task data.
User-Friendly Interface: The app provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for task management.

# Project Structure
The repository structure adheres to Django's best practices, with a dedicated app for managing tasks. While the project primarily focuses on essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, it provides valuable insights into Django's powerful capabilities in building web applications.
